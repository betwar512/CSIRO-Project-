# CSIRO-Project-

  Collection of semantic technology (RDFS,OWL2,SKOS) applied into the Graph to provide Enriched Mature and easy instruction Data out of Complex ODM object design .By this method technical researched data can be redden in detail and easy even by none technical person compare to ODM xml that have to apply Extra layout by secondary system to be able to extract the information.
 Design follows standard of CDISC and adopting the ODM information, also implement Ontology by leveraging vocabularies such as LcdcCore, LcdcOdm, Qb, etc .
  
The scope of this project is focused on Cardio study for 3 categories :
•	Vital signs
•	Blood measurements 
•	medications.

  The system split each of the data about particular category into the Three linked files internally by ontology and also linkset to external ontology snomed.
  Each generated file complement the related linked file in manner of ODM instruction.
Each group includes 3 type of Model as smaller Graphs: Variable, Cardio, Observation.
